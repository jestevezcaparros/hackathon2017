# Use case description:
- In our project, we´ve changed the demo of VALO to show the skill of each attendee instead of the happiness.
- In Ionic app you can introduce your skill so it can be showed at the map.
- In the visualization map, you can see icons showing the skill selected by each attendee.
- When an attendee enter in a room, this room gets colored by the skill of the attendee. The more people with the skill
 the more opacity gets the color. If there´s the same number of different skills, the room gets gray.
- So, we have a flow of streams generated by the simulator or by the mobile app created in ionic. These streams stored in VALO 
 are loaded into the map to show where is each attendee and what´s the skill.
- You can click on any attendee to see the information that was introduced on the mobile app. 
- We add also some code to light Philips Vue bulbs depending on the skill. This code is not yet conected to events in VALO.
