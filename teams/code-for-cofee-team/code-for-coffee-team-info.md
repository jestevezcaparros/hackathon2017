### Use case description

  We created an automated feedback/help system for the conference's attendees.
  Using simple tweets with preset hash tags allows real time interaction
  with the staff.  
  Our concrete example was the ability to ask for new coffee via an AWS Dash button.
  A lighting system based on Phlipps Hue as well as a voice from a Google speaker
  provide direct feedback to the attendee. Status changes like 'coffee is on the way'
  'coffee has been refilled' are also communicated in light and voice.
  The idea is easily extensible towards new use cases like asynchronous registration,
  issue tracking and more.
